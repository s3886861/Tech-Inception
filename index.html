										<h2>Joseph</h2>
										<p>Joseph Thannheiser (s3887138) is 24 years old, was born in Brisbane and has lived in Queensland for most of his life. At the end of October 2020, he moved to Sydney, New South Wales and is now only a 10-minute walk from Bondi Beach. Growing up, he attended Wellington Point State High School in South East Queensland and graduated in 2013. He has always enjoyed using technology – whether it be to play games, communicating with friends and peers, or to study online. Joseph is currently studying with RMIT and is enrolled in Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming. Though his experience with IT is mostly informal, Joseph has learned a lot about both computer software and hardware as well as how to build and maintain his own PC. In his free time, he enjoys playing video games, going to the beach, and hanging out with his partner Eloise and their new kitten Rudy.</p>
										<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
										<p>Joseph has completed the Myer-Briggs Personality Type (MBTI) test, the Honey and Mumford Learning Styles (HMLS) test, and the Big Five Personalities Test. Regarding the MBTI, Joseph is an ISFJ or Defender type. This personality type is defined as being reliable, altruistic and patient with some negatives being shy or excessive humility, taking things too personally and reluctant to changes.  His Learning Style result shows that he prefers pragmatic learning styles which is the dominant learning style in the group. Joseph’s Big Five results are in line with the results from his MBTI test – again showing that he is introverted and conscientious while being agreeable and calm.
										<br><br>In team situations, Joseph prefers to follow instructions instead of giving them out. Though the Defender personality is also classed as loyal and hard-working, they can also be prone to bouts of procrastination. Joseph can adapt to new situations and groups well enough but prefers to be quiet and listen instead of making decisions.

										<h2>Benjamin</h2>
										<p>Benjamin James Snelgrove was born in Sydney, Australia in 1994. He attended Kingswood High School in Greater Western Sydney and successfully attained his Higher School Certificate in 2011. At the beginning of 2012, Benjamin enlisted into the Australian Army and was posted to Darwin. Benjamin has been fortunate enough to move around Australia and live in some incredible places. This within itself, this has presented Benjamin with both challenges and opportunities, for which he is grateful for. Benjamin is currently studying, Introduction to Information Technology at RMIT and can be found by using his unique student number -s3883299. Unfortunately, Benjamin does not have any experience within IT but his interests lie within Cyber Security with the hope to secure employment, on completion of his studies. Benjamin’s hobbies include playing golf, working out, gaming and spending quality time with his wife, Tina.</p>
										<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
										<p>The MBTI and Leadership Style Assessment have defined Benjamin’s traits as being an Executive and a Transformative leader. A close analysis determined his persona to be direct, dedicated, hardworking, strong willed and above all Benjamin places a high value on honesty and integrity. He has little tolerance for those who those who do not share the same values and can be seen as judgemental and inflexible. As a Transformative Leader, Benjamin places a high importance on understanding team dynamics and individual motivations. He tends to weigh in on options while analysing risk versus rewards and recognises that simplicity is best achieved by providing clear direction and guidance.
										<br><br>Benjamin is a Pragmatist learner which was determined by the Honey and Mumford Learning Style test. This style of learning is best achieved through practical's, case studies, problem settings and discussions as opposed to other learning methods like storytelling or models.
										<br><br>For the group to function effectively, Benjamin has identified possible friction points that might arise due to the aforementioned test results. He needs to consider his approach and use language that is appropriate for the target audience, in order to break down barriers and communicate effectively. Benjamin also needs to understand that people will work within their own capacity and expectations require adjustment as individual efforts, great or small are essential to team success. The importance of knowing and understanding each other’s learning style will allow team members to effectively assist another member and provide a personalised approach to guidance and mentoring.</p>

										<a><img src="images/Brandon_head.png" width=20% height=20% alt="Brandon"></a>
										<h2>Brandon</h2>
										<p>Brandon Ferguson (s3876709) currently a student at RMIT, was born in 1999 at Geelong Hospital and has lived there his whole life. Brandon was employed by McDonalds for 5 years and completed VCE at North Geelong Secondary College in 2016. In his spare time, Brandon enjoys training at the gym, enjoys life's adventures, plays a lot of video games and spending quality time with friends and family. From an early age, Brandon developed a keen interest in IT, as his love for video gaming opened another doorway to creating and hosting private servers. But still even with doing what he found entertaining in the tech world, Brandon is yet to acquire the related qualifications and experience to move to the next level.</p>
										<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
										<p>Brandon has taken 3 personality tests, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (16 Personalities) test, the Honey and Mumford Learning styles test and finally the Big Five Personality styles test.
										<br><br>The MBTI test indicated that Brandon is a Turbulent Mediator, which means that he is quite laid back, prefers to remain in the shadows and could even be labelled as shy and introverted person. He will listen to what other have to say and just go with the flow which is good when he is in a group with people who like to make orders and assign tasks to him. The tests also show that he likes to speak the truth, when he says something as rare as that moment, it will come from the heart.<br><br>
										The Honey and Mumford learning styles test indicate that Brandon’s primary learning style is the Activist learning style which means Brandon is very open-minded, enthusiastic and flexible which can be useful when working with others as he can agree with almost anything that the team suggests. This tends to lead to less conflict in the decision-making process and allows things to get moving in order to complete the task.
										<br><br>Unlike the previous tests, the Big Five Personality test says that Brandon is quite extroverted which shows in certain situations. Brandon can sometimes be introverted or extroverted, which is why Brandon likes to label himself as an introverted extrovert. His emotional stability is quite high which allows him to handle criticism well which is good when working in a group as it helps him progress through his flaws.

										<a><img src="images/Varsh_Head.png" width=20% height=20% alt="Varshan"></a>
										<h2>Varshan</h2>
										<p>Varshan Shankar (s3886861) is a 24 year old Singaporean who was born in Singapore in 1996. He is an Indian Hindu and a vegetarian since young due to religion and so hardly eats meat. He completed a Diploma in Electronic and Computer Engineering in Ngee Ann Polytechnic in Singapore. Varshan is bilingual in English and Tamil. His passion for sport is soccer, when he is not playing the world game with friends, he is watching soccer matches on television. His other interests include playing computer and console games and exploring food places. Varshan is currently studying Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming at RMIT. He chose these courses at RMIT as it is very flexible, it allows him to customise his time accordingly for studies in the busy schedule, he likes everything IT related and RMIT is well recognised in the area of IT study.</p>
										<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
										<p>Varshan conducted a total of three tests: Myers-Briggs test, learning styles test and leadership style test.
								    <br><br>The Myers-Briggs Test result defines Varshan as a ESFJ-A consul assertive type. This means that Varshan is people oriented and tends to be up to date with social relationships. It also defines him as a person who likes to keep the energy flowing in a group, motivate and support people, prefers things in an organised and clean fashion and places importance to values and morals. To add on, the result defines him as a person who regrets outcomes more than my actions.
								    <br><br>The Learning Style Test result defines Varshan as being more of Pragmist type learner which means he learns better when things are done practically or through discussions. This is followed closely by Activist where he can also learn through brainstorming and roleplaying in group discussions and finally a Theorist suggesting he can learn through models and tutorials. Lowest type will be the Reflector style which means he learns less from careful and analytical learning through self-analysis questionnaires and time out discussions.
								    <br><br>The Leadership Style Test result defines Varshan as being a Servant Leader which means he cares for others and enjoys looking out for the team and watching us grow together. It also defines him as a person who binds people together and communities while having ethical priorities and humility for interactions.
								    <br><br>These test results suggest that in a team, Varshan will be the person who will drive and support team members emotions and ideas and organise them accordingly. He will be more involved in supporting and helping out team members experiencing difficulties and help the team grow and enjoy together as a whole. Also, he will be the member who is more hands on and practical based and will be involved more in discussions and brainstorming ideas actively in the team.

										<a><img src="images/Viktor_head.png" width=20% height=20% alt="Viktor"></a>
										<h2>Viktor</h2>
										<p>Viktor Komaromi was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1975. He immigrated to Australia in 1988 and graduated High School in 1993 from Lynwood Senior High in Western Australia. He continued his education at TAFE and after completing a couple of Certificates in Information Technology he began studying Multimedia and Computer Systems Engineering. Due to a fortunate turn of events while looking for a casual job, he was offered a full-time position at a small computer shop which offered to train him. He accepted and has been working in the IT Industry since 1997. He’s gained experience in a variety of roles, including computer repairs, sales, assembly, troubleshooting as well as held the positions of IT Consultant, IT Technician, Helpdesk Officer, Audio Visual Technician and Network Manager.

Viktor’s hobbies include spending quality time with his wife and kids, reading about new technologies, watching Anime and gaming.</p>
										<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
										<p>Viktor is an introvert by nature as reflected clearly in his Myer-Brigg’s test results. This is often demonstrated in his ability to work independently on tasks. He values individualism and this allows him to be creative and solve problems on his own. Being an Adventurer type person, Viktor prefers adaptation and spontaneity in tasks over meticulous organisation and micromanagement. His best contribution to the team will be his role as an explorer. He functions best when given the opportunity to investigate a variety of scenarios and strategies and taking on input from the team to explore best possible solutions.
										<br><br>The Big Personality Test results highlight Viktor’s agreeable nature to please the people around him. This trait also allows him to be flexible when working with others and when coming up with alternative solutions to problems. In a team environment, Viktor will feel most comfortable when he’s working to solve problems and when he’s being helpful to others in the team. He does not shy away from teamwork and enjoys learning from others as well as synergising to create new possibilities and ideas. His curiosity and passion for technology and non-assertive nature fuels his contribution when working with others.
										<br><br>Viktor is a mild kinesthetic learner making him a very practical participant of any group. He learns and works best with hands on experiences, by doing and figuring things out for himself and when solving practical problems and helping others. He is best paired in a team with someone strong in time management and logistical details who has the ability to keep him ‘grounded’ while he delves into the idealistic problem-solving world. His most valuable contribution to the team will come in the form of his creativity and ability to research and finding solutions to problems.

										<h1 style="text-align:center;">Ideal Jobs</h1>
									</header>
										<div>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Automation Developer:</strong> Varshan</li>
											<li><strong>Data Analyst:</strong> Daniela</li>
											<li><strong>Game Designer:</strong> Brandon</li>
											<li><strong>IT Manager:</strong> Viktor</li>
											<li><strong>Penetration Tester:</strong> Joseph and Benjamin </li>
										</ul>
										<br>
										<H2>Commonalities</H2>
										<p>According to the data gathered from Burning Glass and Job Outlook, the common areas that link the group’s Ideal Jobs pertain to certain qualifications and skills. Today, to maximise professional success within the IT industry, an undergraduate degree in an IT associated field is essential. For Tech Inception specific job roles, postgraduate certificates are highly desirable. This, along with hands on experience will only make us more competitive when applying for our ideal roles. Other than education, the ideal jobs chosen by each member of the group also require soft skills including communication, problem solving, troubleshooting, and teamwork and collaboration. A shared skill (IT) required by Penetration Testers, Game Designers, Data Analyst and AI and Automation Developers is programming as these jobs consist of both analysing and producing code. See Figure 1. Skills Required for Job, Ideal Jobs 2021, to compare the skills required for each team members Ideal Jobs.</p>
										<H2>Differentiation</H2>
										<p>Differences in employment categories can be determined by the specific roles each member of the group has chosen and how their basic skill set evolves. Most of the IT positions require similar skills and are considered transferrable to other roles, such as teamwork, problem solving and communication. However, analysing data to determine best practice in penetration testing or consumer feedback on an application release, differs from analysing Big Data for corporations. The main differences between the roles are determined by the degree of sophistication and level of skill required to complete the task. Game Design also has specific skills that differentiate from the group in creativity, fine arts and technical design. Hacking and Programming are similar skillsets that require people with the desire to code and debug, something that three of our team members need for their respective roles as Penetration Testers and AI & Automation Developers. Management is the only skillset unique to our group and very specific to IT Managers. That said, while many of the roles are quite specific in terms of their specialisation, all of them possess the potential to lead to a management or leadership style position within the same field. Although Post Graduate study could be applied to any role, both Penetration Testing and Game Design would benefit from this to increase employability up front especially as Game Design is a small and very competitive industry in Australia.  </p>
										<H2>Similarities</H2>
										<p>Benjamin, Brandon, Varshan, Joseph, Viktor and Daniela all have a similar strategy to attaining their ideal jobs which is to continue their studies through RMIT, earning their Bachelor of IT. Daniela will also be taking on additional finance and economic subjects to expand knowledge for the specific field of employment she is aiming to transition into.  Of the six group members, Viktor is currently employed in the field of IT and is looking to further his career which requires a University degree. The remaining five members of the group are seeking to gain entry to IT as it is an expanding field that is constantly advancing and innovating. Given the data represented by Table 2. and Figure 4, you can see that 50% of our group still needs to acquire a majority of the required skills for their selected positions while the other 50% requires less than 30%.</p>

										<h2>What type of work is done by the IT professional?</h2>
										<p>
											Mr Adrian Beck is the Director of Information Systems at St Mary’s Anglican Girl’s School in Western Australia. His main role within IT is to oversee all industry related projects on behalf of the principal and the school. Some of these projects have him supervise the installation and upgrade of all audio/visual components in 31 different classrooms or testing new network security features, that before his time, were not possible. Mr Beck believes that a “stronger security posture” needs to be adopted within the school. Current security measures are “more reactive as opposed to proactive”, so the IT team has been busy conducting password sprays and a simulated dictionary attack to test for further vulnerabilities. Mr Beck’s main focus is predominantly within the IT department, managing his team and ensuring that work is being carried out efficiently. Although, he has another key appointment that is essential to the running of the school – being a member of the Executive Board. This role has other unique responsibilities that include budget management, meetings with the Principal, the Deans, and the Director of Business Operations. At the same time, it also allows Mr Beck to have more insight as to how the school is operating and have a voice in the adoption and implementation of new Technologies in the school.
										</p>
										<br><h2>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h2>
										<p>
											As Mr Beck has multiple roles at St Mary’s Anglican Girls School, he interacts and communicates with different types of professionals at different intervals throughout the day. Currently Mr Beck leads a team of seven IT professionals including four Technicians, one Helpdesk Operator and one Network Manager. Mr Beck also has the opportunity to interact with external contractors who carry out work for the school. Stepping away from the IT department, Mr Beck communicates with a range of other constituents ranging from students, parents and staff members, to the Executive board which hosts individuals such as the Principal, Vice-Principal, Deans and Business Managers. Mr Beck also regularly meets with sales representatives from IT Businesses, Products and Software vendors to discuss the needs of the school. Lastly, he stays in constant communication with his peers at other schools around the country with the help of a mailing list that allows them to request assistance for issues, share ideas and implementation details for various technologies, compare what tools they use and why, and stay abreast of any major developments that he needs to be aware of.
										</p>
										<br><h2>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h2>
										<p>
											IT professionals spend a great deal of time during the day monitoring systems and responding to technical issues. Depending on their position, their work would differ in its scope and complexity. In the case of Mr Beck’s workplace at St Mary’s, an IT Technician would spend much of their day responding to urgent calls for assistance from staff members and students. This involves moving around the school campus to assist with projector connection problems, wireless issues, printing difficulties and software difficulties. The Helpdesk Officer deals mainly with support calls over the phone and assists people who come to visit the Helpdesk Office in person. The Network Manager monitors the school network hardware as well as the flow of data, wireless systems, servers and looks for ways to improve them. Mr Beck as the Director of IT partakes in various meetings and spends much of his time working on larger projects which include school reports as well as the school IT Budget. They all work together as a team and support each other when needed. Another common aspect of most IT positions is to research and expand their knowledge where possible. There is always a solution to every problem and there is always more to learn.
										</p>
										<br><h2>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h2>
										<p>
											Mr Beck identified that his biggest challenges within the workplace lie within the school’s budget allocation and cybersecurity threats.
										As a member of the Executive board, Mr Beck’s role is to help allocate funds to different departments around the school. IT being a resource intensive department, the school’s allocated budget needs to be regularly monitored and shared according to the business direction provided by the school Principal. Budgets always start out very large as all the requests pile in and then go through many reviews and revisions where decisions have to be made as to what to keep, what to delay and what to cut. It is very time consuming and highly stressful.
										<br>
										However, when compared to budget concerns, cybersecurity is Mr Beck’s biggest worry and the most challenging problem in the workplace. Mr Beck regularly thinks “What's happening with malware? What are the current threats that are actually taking place while I'm asleep?”. Then of course, questions start to arise, “Do we have enough protection? Are our staff suitably skilled?”. According to Mr Beck, the weakest point in security is the staff. Training them to be security conscious is a never-ending battle and Mr Beck realizes that it is one of the most challenging aspects of his work. Security is the opposite of convenience and while some staff might find it easier to login to their workstations with a simple password such as Allan246, it will not stop a hacker from brute forcing that password quickly and gaining access to the network to infect it with ransomware. The dangers this threat pose to the business as a whole is quite devastating both financially and in terms of reputation. As the threat landscape increases and matures, its more and more important to work proactively to combat this issue. It is quite challenging indeed and as Mr Beck indicated to us in his interview, his goal is to employ an IT Professional with a background in Cybersecurity to work with him and his team to proactively monitor and respond to security threats to the school.

								<h2> Autonomous Vehicles </h2>
								<p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) can be described as any vehicle that has the capability for motion and action with little to no human interference, whether that interference be remote or from inside the vehicle itself (Frazzoli, Dahleh, & Feron, 2002). Though the idea of them may seem futuristic, evidence of AVs exists as far back as 1986 at Carnegie-Mellon University in the form of the Navlab prototypes, though the functionality at the time was extremely basic due to the lack of compact computing power (Jochem, Pomerleau, Kumar & Armstrong, 1995). The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International, 2018) has outlined the 6 levels of vehicle automation from 0 to 5, with 0 having no automation and 5 being fully autonomous. Since the Navlab experiments at Carnegie-Mellon University, autonomous driving technology has come a long way and is now available to the consumer market from various automotive companies. Tesla’s Autopilot and General Motors’ (GM) Super Cruise are two such offerings, though currently they only offer level 2 automation. As can be seen in Figure 1, this is classed as partial automation and still requires constant monitoring by the driver.</p>
<p>
SAE Levels of Driving Automation

Figure 1 (Synopsys, 2020)
</p>
<p>
Though there are AVs capable of level 4 automation, outdated legislation and infrastructure limits where they are safely able to function in a process known as geofencing (Synopsys, 2020). In 2018, an AV company by the name of Waymo announced a driverless taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona that would operate in four suburbs: Chandler, Tempe, Gilbert and Mesa (Sage, 2018). Initially, this service had a human behind the wheel to ensure a safe trip for passengers but, by the end of 2020 it was able to transition to a near driverless experience with each vehicle having a remote supervisor to assist when more dynamic situations would arise. For example, a Waymo spokesperson explained to Lee (2020) ‘if a Waymo vehicle detects that a road ahead may be closed due to construction, it can pull over and request a second set of eyes’. Waymo’s choice to start rolling out their service in these Phoenix suburbs is not an irrelevant detail as weather conditions play a big part in how well AVs operate.

In the next 3 years and further moving forward, large amounts of autonomous vehicles are expected to be rapidly deployed around the world with the rise of sensor technologies and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). ABI Research (2018) predicts that approximately 8 million vehicles featuring level 3, 4 and 5 autonomous functions will be shipped in 2025 and available to the mass market. While the vehicles featuring level 3 and 4 AV functions may still need drivers due to certain driving conditions requiring human intervention, vehicles with level 5 autonomy will be able to operate completely autonomously with no driver intervention at all.
</p>
<p>
Other sources, such as Underwood (2014), predict that AVs in 2025 may be able to operate on all forms of road – whether it be highway, urban or rural surfaces. They also predict full level 5 autonomy on all surfaces by at least 2035, effectively eliminating humans from behind the wheel.  Wardrop (2009) proposes that by 2022, 30% of all trucks operating in the United Kingdom have the potential to be fully automated while IEEE (2012) estimates that up to 75% of all vehicles on the road could be fully autonomous by 2040. In the transport and haulage industry, trucks and buses may be the first to see autonomous replacements as the routes taken are far less dynamic than those taken by private commuters.

More and more countries are beginning to legalise the use of AVs on their roads such as the UK, Sweden, and the US. In 2017, Sweden launched the Drive Me project which saw 100 Volvo AVs go to families in Gothenburg. These vehicles were for use on public roads and did not require continuous supervision, allowing the driver to perform other tasks during their trips (Victor et al., 2017). With the research gathered from these countries, there may be more AVs on roads for our use sooner rather than later.
<p>
</p>
The quick rise and development of AVs for use on roads is possible due to advancements in technologies such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors. LiDAR has the potential to provide reliable obstacle detection, coupled with the deployment of various Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) packages by OEMs.

The technological developments of vehicle automation potentially can transform the workforce and impact jobs. The potential impact of automation on employment varies by occupation and sector, with more physical jobs in predictable environments being the most susceptible. These may include operating machinery and preparing fast food. Two more industries that may be affected by automation are collecting and processing data, with jobs such as mortgage origination, paralegal work, accounting, and back-office transaction processing seeing a significant decrease in available work (McKinsey & Co, 2017) due to the evolution of not just vehicle automation, but automation as a whole.

AVs could cause a rise in energy consumption levels when they become the prevalent mode of transport. This predicted rise may be caused by an increased demand for travel due to the on-demand mobility they offer, which in turn increases the amount of energy used by AVs. Another driving factor for this rise may be because of the accessibility these vehicles provide, allowing people who do not drive as much or not have been driving for a period of time to make use of the services offered by AVs.
<p>
</p>
At the same time, AVs may be able to help energy consumption due to efficient driving methods, through a concept known as platooning. Platooning is when multiple vehicles all operate in a tight group together which helps to reduce forces imposed upon the vehicles (especially those in the center) while driving. This method of driving is not possible for humans due to the reaction times required to brake without causing a crash. AVs would not have this issue due to their ability to communicate and execute commands based on their surroundings (Wadud, MacKenzie & Leiby, 2016).
</p>
<p>
The establishment of AVs as the conventional method of both private and public transportation is still several years from fruition. Though level 5 autonomy is on the horizon, current AVs are only able to operate in a limited capacity – whether this limit be geofenced areas or the requirement of constant human oversight. As the adoption rate of AVs increases, positives and negatives may become more apparent in day-to-day life. Some such benefits may include a decrease in traffic congestion, increased mobility for people with disabilities or the elderly, and an overall safer experience for both pedestrians and drivers. With over 90% of crashes caused by human error (NHTSA, 2015) the adoption of AVs has the potential for a large positive impact on road safety due to the communicative ability they possess with each other. However, accidents are not always avoidable.
</p>
<p>
AVs may encounter ethical issues relating to the safety of the driver versus the safety of pedestrians in impact scenarios. In these types of scenarios, a computer may make unpredictable decisions and end up causing more harm than a human driver. While there are benefits to consider, there are also negative aspects of AVs, such as the threat of cybersecurity related attacks. A person with malicious intent may be able to compromise an AV to disable safety features and cause an impact, steal private information such as where an individual may live or work, or reroute the destination of the AV. Due to the relatively small demand for AVs, another factor that is against them is the cost. Without a large network of AVs in operation and because they rely on communication within a network, congestion mitigation could be completely nullified due to the lack of information available. Weather and terrain may also have an adverse effect on AVs, with the functionality being reduced or even fully negated due to rain, snow or uneven terrain (Anderson et al., 2014). Until these issues are investigated further, autonomous driving may still be years away from being available to the public at large.
