							<h2>Joseph</h2>
							<p>Joseph Thannheiser (s3887138) is 24 years old, was born in Brisbane and has lived in Queensland for most of his life. At the end of October 2020, he moved to Sydney, New South Wales and is now only a 10-minute walk from Bondi Beach. Growing up, he attended Wellington Point State High School in South East Queensland and graduated in 2013. He has always enjoyed using technology – whether it be to play games, communicating with friends and peers, or to study online. Joseph is currently studying with RMIT and is enrolled in Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming. Though his experience with IT is mostly informal, Joseph has learned a lot about both computer software and hardware as well as how to build and maintain his own PC. In his free time, he enjoys playing video games, going to the beach, and hanging out with his partner Eloise and their new kitten Rudy.</p>
							<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
							<p>Joseph has completed the Myer-Briggs Personality Type (MBTI) test, the Honey and Mumford Learning Styles (HMLS) test, and the Big Five Personalities Test. Regarding the MBTI, Joseph is an ISFJ or Defender type. This personality type is defined as being reliable, altruistic and patient with some negatives being shy or excessive humility, taking things too personally and reluctant to changes.  His Learning Style result shows that he prefers pragmatic learning styles which is the dominant learning style in the group. Joseph’s Big Five results are in line with the results from his MBTI test – again showing that he is introverted and conscientious while being agreeable and calm.
								<br><br>In team situations, Joseph prefers to follow instructions instead of giving them out. Though the Defender personality is also classed as loyal and hard-working, they can also be prone to bouts of procrastination. Joseph can adapt to new situations and groups well enough but prefers to be quiet and listen instead of making decisions.

							<h2>Benjamin</h2>
							<p>Benjamin James Snelgrove was born in Sydney, Australia in 1994. He attended Kingswood High School in Greater Western Sydney and successfully attained his Higher School Certificate in 2011. At the beginning of 2012, Benjamin enlisted into the Australian Army and was posted to Darwin. Benjamin has been fortunate enough to move around Australia and live in some incredible places. This within itself, this has presented Benjamin with both challenges and opportunities, for which he is grateful for. Benjamin is currently studying, Introduction to Information Technology at RMIT and can be found by using his unique student number -s3883299. Unfortunately, Benjamin does not have any experience within IT but his interests lie within Cyber Security with the hope to secure employment, on completion of his studies. Benjamin’s hobbies include playing golf, working out, gaming and spending quality time with his wife, Tina.</p>
							<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
							<p>The MBTI and Leadership Style Assessment have defined Benjamin’s traits as being an Executive and a Transformative leader. A close analysis determined his persona to be direct, dedicated, hardworking, strong willed and above all Benjamin places a high value on honesty and integrity. He has little tolerance for those who those who do not share the same values and can be seen as judgemental and inflexible. As a Transformative Leader, Benjamin places a high importance on understanding team dynamics and individual motivations. He tends to weigh in on options while analysing risk versus rewards and recognises that simplicity is best achieved by providing clear direction and guidance.
								<br><br>Benjamin is a Pragmatist learner which was determined by the Honey and Mumford Learning Style test. This style of learning is best achieved through practical's, case studies, problem settings and discussions as opposed to other learning methods like storytelling or models.
								<br><br>For the group to function effectively, Benjamin has identified possible friction points that might arise due to the aforementioned test results. He needs to consider his approach and use language that is appropriate for the target audience, in order to break down barriers and communicate effectively. Benjamin also needs to understand that people will work within their own capacity and expectations require adjustment as individual efforts, great or small are essential to team success. The importance of knowing and understanding each other’s learning style will allow team members to effectively assist another member and provide a personalised approach to guidance and mentoring.</p>

								<a><img src="images/Brandon_head.png" width=20% height=20% alt="Brandon"></a>
								<h2>Brandon</h2>
								<p>Brandon Ferguson (s3876709) currently a student at RMIT, was born in 1999 at Geelong Hospital and has lived there his whole life. Brandon was employed by McDonalds for 5 years and completed VCE at North Geelong Secondary College in 2016. In his spare time, Brandon enjoys training at the gym, enjoys life's adventures, plays a lot of video games and spending quality time with friends and family. From an early age, Brandon developed a keen interest in IT, as his love for video gaming opened another doorway to creating and hosting private servers. But still even with doing what he found entertaining in the tech world, Brandon is yet to acquire the related qualifications and experience to move to the next level.</p>
								<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
								<p>Brandon has taken 3 personality tests, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (16 Personalities) test, the Honey and Mumford Learning styles test and finally the Big Five Personality styles test.
									<br><br>The MBTI test indicated that Brandon is a Turbulent Mediator, which means that he is quite laid back, prefers to remain in the shadows and could even be labelled as shy and introverted person. He will listen to what other have to say and just go with the flow which is good when he is in a group with people who like to make orders and assign tasks to him. The tests also show that he likes to speak the truth, when he says something as rare as that moment, it will come from the heart.<br><br>
									The Honey and Mumford learning styles test indicate that Brandon’s primary learning style is the Activist learning style which means Brandon is very open-minded, enthusiastic and flexible which can be useful when working with others as he can agree with almost anything that the team suggests. This tends to lead to less conflict in the decision-making process and allows things to get moving in order to complete the task.
									<br><br>Unlike the previous tests, the Big Five Personality test says that Brandon is quite extroverted which shows in certain situations. Brandon can sometimes be introverted or extroverted, which is why Brandon likes to label himself as an introverted extrovert. His emotional stability is quite high which allows him to handle criticism well which is good when working in a group as it helps him progress through his flaws.

She will openly advise teammates that she appreciates a project timeline to make sure that it stays on track and will monitor this.  Daniela always encourages open communication and regular meetings to make sure the project is on track and would ask as many questions as needed to ensure understanding.
									<br><br>When working in teams, Daniela works best with people that have an open and honest communication style, with the ability to listen to the whole team without pushing a single agenda or idea.  She works well with people who encourage engagement while keeping things on track to meet clearly defined goals.

								<a><img src="images/Varsh_Head.png" width=20% height=20% alt="Varshan"></a>
								<h2>Varshan</h2>
								<p>Varshan Shankar (s3886861) is a 24 year old Singaporean who was born in Singapore in 1996. He is an Indian Hindu and a vegetarian since young due to religion and so hardly eats meat. He completed a Diploma in Electronic and Computer Engineering in Ngee Ann Polytechnic in Singapore. Varshan is bilingual in English and Tamil. His passion for sport is soccer, when he is not playing the world game with friends, he is watching soccer matches on television. His other interests include playing computer and console games and exploring food places. Varshan is currently studying Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming at RMIT. He chose these courses at RMIT as it is very flexible, it allows him to customise his time accordingly for studies in the busy schedule, he likes everything IT related and RMIT is well recognised in the area of IT study.</p>
								<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
								<p>Varshan conducted a total of three tests: Myers-Briggs test, learning styles test and leadership style test.
									<br><br>The Myers-Briggs Test result defines Varshan as a ESFJ-A consul assertive type. This means that Varshan is people oriented and tends to be up to date with social relationships. It also defines him as a person who likes to keep the energy flowing in a group, motivate and support people, prefers things in an organised and clean fashion and places importance to values and morals. To add on, the result defines him as a person who regrets outcomes more than my actions.
									<br><br>The Learning Style Test result defines Varshan as being more of Pragmist type learner which means he learns better when things are done practically or through discussions. This is followed closely by Activist where he can also learn through brainstorming and roleplaying in group discussions and finally a Theorist suggesting he can learn through models and tutorials. Lowest type will be the Reflector style which means he learns less from careful and analytical learning through self-analysis questionnaires and time out discussions.
									<br><br>The Leadership Style Test result defines Varshan as being a Servant Leader which means he cares for others and enjoys looking out for the team and watching us grow together. It also defines him as a person who binds people together and communities while having ethical priorities and humility for interactions.
									<br><br>These test results suggest that in a team, Varshan will be the person who will drive and support team members emotions and ideas and organise them accordingly. He will be more involved in supporting and helping out team members experiencing difficulties and help the team grow and enjoy together as a whole. Also, he will be the member who is more hands on and practical based and will be involved more in discussions and brainstorming ideas actively in the team.

								<a><img src="images/Viktor_head.png" width=20% height=20% alt="Viktor"></a>
								<h2>Viktor</h2>
								<p>Viktor Komaromi was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1975. He immigrated to Australia in 1988 and graduated High School in 1993 from Lynwood Senior High in Western Australia. He continued his education at TAFE and after completing a couple of Certificates in Information Technology he began studying Multimedia and Computer Systems Engineering. Due to a fortunate turn of events while looking for a casual job, he was offered a full-time position at a small computer shop which offered to train him. He accepted and has been working in the IT Industry since 1997. He’s gained experience in a variety of roles, including computer repairs, sales, assembly, troubleshooting as well as held the positions of IT Consultant, IT Technician, Helpdesk Officer, Audio Visual Technician and Network Manager.

Viktor’s hobbies include spending quality time with his wife and kids, reading about new technologies, watching Anime and gaming.</p>
								<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
								<p>Viktor is an introvert by nature as reflected clearly in his Myer-Brigg’s test results. This is often demonstrated in his ability to work independently on tasks. He values individualism and this allows him to be creative and solve problems on his own. Being an Adventurer type person, Viktor prefers adaptation and spontaneity in tasks over meticulous organisation and micromanagement. His best contribution to the team will be his role as an explorer. He functions best when given the opportunity to investigate a variety of scenarios and strategies and taking on input from the team to explore best possible solutions.
									<br><br>The Big Personality Test results highlight Viktor’s agreeable nature to please the people around him. This trait also allows him to be flexible when working with others and when coming up with alternative solutions to problems. In a team environment, Viktor will feel most comfortable when he’s working to solve problems and when he’s being helpful to others in the team. He does not shy away from teamwork and enjoys learning from others as well as synergising to create new possibilities and ideas. His curiosity and passion for technology and non-assertive nature fuels his contribution when working with others.
									<br><br>Viktor is a mild kinesthetic learner making him a very practical participant of any group. He learns and works best with hands on experiences, by doing and figuring things out for himself and when solving practical problems and helping others. He is best paired in a team with someone strong in time management and logistical details who has the ability to keep him ‘grounded’ while he delves into the idealistic problem-solving world. His most valuable contribution to the team will come in the form of his creativity and ability to research and finding solutions to problems.

							<h1 style="text-align:center;">Ideal Jobs</h1>
						</header>
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Automation Developer:</strong> Varshan</li>
								<li><strong>Data Analyst:</strong> Daniela</li>
								<li><strong>Game Designer:</strong> Brandon</li>
								<li><strong>IT Manager:</strong> Viktor</li>
								<li><strong>Penetration Tester:</strong> Joseph and Benjamin </li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<H2>Commonalities</H2>
							<p>According to the data gathered from Burning Glass and Job Outlook, the common areas that link the group’s Ideal Jobs pertain to certain qualifications and skills. Today, to maximise professional success within the IT industry, an undergraduate degree in an IT associated field is essential. For Tech Inception specific job roles, postgraduate certificates are highly desirable. This, along with hands on experience will only make us more competitive when applying for our ideal roles. Other than education, the ideal jobs chosen by each member of the group also require soft skills including communication, problem solving, troubleshooting, and teamwork and collaboration. A shared skill (IT) required by Penetration Testers, Game Designers, Data Analyst and AI and Automation Developers is programming as these jobs consist of both analysing and producing code. See Figure 1. Skills Required for Job, Ideal Jobs 2021, to compare the skills required for each team members Ideal Jobs.</p>
							<H2>Differentiation</H2>
							<p>Differences in employment categories can be determined by the specific roles each member of the group has chosen and how their basic skill set evolves. Most of the IT positions require similar skills and are considered transferrable to other roles, such as teamwork, problem solving and communication. However, analysing data to determine best practice in penetration testing or consumer feedback on an application release, differs from analysing Big Data for corporations. The main differences between the roles are determined by the degree of sophistication and level of skill required to complete the task. Game Design also has specific skills that differentiate from the group in creativity, fine arts and technical design. Hacking and Programming are similar skillsets that require people with the desire to code and debug, something that three of our team members need for their respective roles as Penetration Testers and AI & Automation Developers. Management is the only skillset unique to our group and very specific to IT Managers. That said, while many of the roles are quite specific in terms of their specialisation, all of them possess the potential to lead to a management or leadership style position within the same field. Although Post Graduate study could be applied to any role, both Penetration Testing and Game Design would benefit from this to increase employability up front especially as Game Design is a small and very competitive industry in Australia.  </p>
							<H2>Similarities</H2>
							<p>Benjamin, Brandon, Varshan, Joseph, Viktor and Daniela all have a similar strategy to attaining their ideal jobs which is to continue their studies through RMIT, earning their Bachelor of IT. Daniela will also be taking on additional finance and economic subjects to expand knowledge for the specific field of employment she is aiming to transition into.  Of the six group members, Viktor is currently employed in the field of IT and is looking to further his career which requires a University degree. The remaining five members of the group are seeking to gain entry to IT as it is an expanding field that is constantly advancing and innovating. Given the data represented by Table 2. and Figure 4, you can see that 50% of our group still needs to acquire a majority of the required skills for their selected positions while the other 50% requires less than 30%.</p>

								<p>Source: Figure 3 - Top IT Job Titles and Top IT Job Titles 2018.xlsx (Burning Data 2018)</p>


								<li><b>From your group's ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group's required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).</b></li>

								<p><b>Generic Skills</b></p>

								<p><b>IT Specific Skills</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Programming – RNK 1 (Java, JavaScript, SQL)– RNK 1</li>
									<li>Troubleshooting – RNK 6</li>

								</ul>
								<p><i>Source: Figure 1 -Top IT Skills and Top IT Job Skills 2018.xlsx(Burning Data 2018)</i></p>

								<p><b> A.  How does the IT specific Skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</b></p>
								<p>As reported by Figure 1 -Top IT Skills and Top IT Job Skills 2018.xlsx (Burning Data 2018), Tech Inception’s top IT skill is highly in demand from employers. Three of the five skills are in the top 20 skills required by employers. Programming with regards to Java, JavaScript and SQL was at rank 1, followed by troubleshooting was at rank 6 and hacking with regards to Linux at rank 13. Other IT skills that are common to Tech Inception but not as highly in demand with employers include networking with regards to Network Engineering at Rank 30 and Data Analysis at Rank 69</p>

								<p><b> B.  How do the generic skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</b></p>
								<p>According to Figure 2 - Top Generic Skills, Tech Inception’s generic skill set are highly desired by employers. In fact, four of the skills outlined by the group are located within the top 40%. Communication was ranked as the number 1 most desired skill for employees, followed by problem solving abilities at rank 2, teamwork collaboration at rank 5 and creativity, ranking 9. Other general skills that are pertinent to Tech Inception are not as desired by employers, such as analytical capacity, ranking 17 of 25.</p>

								<p><b> C.  What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</b></p>
								<p>Microsoft Windows, Project Management, and Systems Applications and Products (SAP) are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not within Tech Inception’s required skill set. As shown by Figure 2, Microsoft Windows is ranked 4th, Project Management is ranked 5th and SAP is ranked 6th. In certain roles, Microsoft Windows experience may automatically be assumed as it is the worldwide most popular operating system in terms of desktop computers (StatCounter Global Stats, 2020). While project management and experience with SAPs may also be valuable skills, they are not required for the ideal positions chosen by the members of Tech Inception.</p>

								<p><b> D.  What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</b></p>
								<p>According to Figure 2 -Top General Skills, the three highest ranked general skills that have not been considered essential by Tech Inception are writing, ranked 4, planning, ranked 7 and detail orientation, ranked 8. These particular skills may still be beneficial from an employer’s point of view or may already be part of a more desirable skill. One such skill may be writing, which may be thought of as a subsection of communication. Planning would be quite useful in both Management positions as well as Cyber Security as there will be Although these skills are not required, they will still prove quite beneficial to each of Tech Inception members and as such should not be ignored.</p>

								<li><b> From looking at burning glass data, has it changed your opinion on your ideal job? Why or why not? </b></li>
								<p>
									With a substantial amount of consideration, all members of Tech Inception have high hopes for their prospects within the IT Industry. According to Figure 3 -Top IT Job Titles and Top IT Job Titles 2018.xlsx, the ideal jobs of a majority of the members in Tech Inception are located within the top 25% of job descriptions that have been favourable over the last twelve months. Information Technology (IT) is a world leading industry that facilitates growth in almost every other sector and as IT becomes more depended upon, the potential growth for the groups ideal jobs is looking highly favourable.
								</p>
									<br>
									<p>
										Here is what the team have to say about their ideal job and the data presented in Burning Glass.
									</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Benjamin</h3>
									<p>
										Although the statistical data can be compelling as it highlights what is becoming essential within the industry, Benjamin is staying on his desired path of becoming a Penetration Tester. After having served in the military for the last nine years, Benjamin has developed a strong desire to help people, and would like to give back to the community upon discharge. In his opinion, this far out weights any statistical value.
									</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Joseph</h3>
									<p>
										After analysing the statistical data, Joseph has decided to continue his learning path to become a penetration tester. Though there are some compelling viewpoints to consider through the discussion this data has generated, ultimately it has had little effect on the decision he has made.
									</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Daniela</h3>
									<p>
										Daniela is set on working in data analytics and understands that there are many options within the Information Technology field to apply her love of economics and data in various roles. To complete her study in IT, only increases her employment options and she feels that the burning glass data cements her career path.
									</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Varshan</h3>
									<p>
										Varshan is still interested in pursuing his career as an Artificial Intelligence and Automation Developer, although the data presented by Burning Glass, has indicated that his desired job and some of the required skills are not in the top tier demands by employers. He will use the Burning Glass Data as a guide on how his desired AI and Automation job and skills rank in demand compared to other jobs and skills within the industry. However, overall, this data did not change Varshan’s opinion on wanting to pursue his desired ideal job.
									</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Viktor</h3>
									<p>
									Viktor’s current position in the IT Industry dictates his desire to advance to the next level which is why he will continue to pursue a management style position in the industry. Despite the data shown in the Burning Glass Top Job Titles spreadsheet, which indicates that the number of postings for IT Management positions are quite low at rank 192, his current skills in Systems Administration is ranked 8 and highly sought after. His current workplace will be offering the IT
										Manager position to him once the current holder retires and that is his goal which he will meet once he completes his Bachelor of IT degree.
									</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Brandon</h3>
									<p>
										After reviewing the burning glass data, Brandon is still wanting to go after his dream job as a Game Designer/Developer. Although the ranking of the job desired is not the highest ranked (Rank 19), it is still fairly highly ranked. With enough experience and perseverance in his academical studies within the IT industry it would seem as if getting a job as a Game Designer/Developer would not be too difficult to achieve. On top of that Brandon has always wanted to be a game Designer/Developer and for personal reasons is willing to do what he can to reach that goal.
									</p>
									<p>
										In summary, all members of Tech Inception have decided to continue with their ideal jobs and not make changes to their career path.

							<br>
							<h2>What type of work is done by the IT professional?</h2>
							<p>
								Mr Adrian Beck is the Director of Information Systems at St Mary’s Anglican Girl’s School in Western Australia. His main role within IT is to oversee all industry related projects on behalf of the principal and the school. Some of these projects have him supervise the installation and upgrade of all audio/visual components in 31 different classrooms or testing new network security features, that before his time, were not possible. Mr Beck believes that a “stronger security posture” needs to be adopted within the school. Current security measures are “more reactive as opposed to proactive”, so the IT team has been busy conducting password sprays and a simulated dictionary attack to test for further vulnerabilities. Mr Beck’s main focus is predominantly within the IT department, managing his team and ensuring that work is being carried out efficiently. Although, he has another key appointment that is essential to the running of the school – being a member of the Executive Board. This role has other unique responsibilities that include budget management, meetings with the Principal, the Deans, and the Director of Business Operations. At the same time, it also allows Mr Beck to have more insight as to how the school is operating and have a voice in the adoption and implementation of new Technologies in the school.
							</p>
							<br><h2>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h2>
							<p>
								As Mr Beck has multiple roles at St Mary’s Anglican Girls School, he interacts and communicates with different types of professionals at different intervals throughout the day. Currently Mr Beck leads a team of seven IT professionals including four Technicians, one Helpdesk Operator and one Network Manager. Mr Beck also has the opportunity to interact with external contractors who carry out work for the school. Stepping away from the IT department, Mr Beck communicates with a range of other constituents ranging from students, parents and staff members, to the Executive board which hosts individuals such as the Principal, Vice-Principal, Deans and Business Managers. Mr Beck also regularly meets with sales representatives from IT Businesses, Products and Software vendors to discuss the needs of the school. Lastly, he stays in constant communication with his peers at other schools around the country with the help of a mailing list that allows them to request assistance for issues, share ideas and implementation details for various technologies, compare what tools they use and why, and stay abreast of any major developments that he needs to be aware of.
							</p>
							<br><h2>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h2>
							<p>
								IT professionals spend a great deal of time during the day monitoring systems and responding to technical issues. Depending on their position, their work would differ in its scope and complexity. In the case of Mr Beck’s workplace at St Mary’s, an IT Technician would spend much of their day responding to urgent calls for assistance from staff members and students. This involves moving around the school campus to assist with projector connection problems, wireless issues, printing difficulties and software difficulties. The Helpdesk Officer deals mainly with support calls over the phone and assists people who come to visit the Helpdesk Office in person. The Network Manager monitors the school network hardware as well as the flow of data, wireless systems, servers and looks for ways to improve them. Mr Beck as the Director of IT partakes in various meetings and spends much of his time working on larger projects which include school reports as well as the school IT Budget. They all work together as a team and support each other when needed. Another common aspect of most IT positions is to research and expand their knowledge where possible. There is always a solution to every problem and there is always more to learn.
							</p>
							<br><h2>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h2>
							<p>
								Mr Beck identified that his biggest challenges within the workplace lie within the school’s budget allocation and cybersecurity threats.
								As a member of the Executive board, Mr Beck’s role is to help allocate funds to different departments around the school. IT being a resource intensive department, the school’s allocated budget needs to be regularly monitored and shared according to the business direction provided by the school Principal. Budgets always start out very large as all the requests pile in and then go through many reviews and revisions where decisions have to be made as to what to keep, what to delay and what to cut. It is very time consuming and highly stressful.
								<br>
								However, when compared to budget concerns, cybersecurity is Mr Beck’s biggest worry and the most challenging problem in the workplace. Mr Beck regularly thinks “What's happening with malware? What are the current threats that are actually taking place while I'm asleep?”. Then of course, questions start to arise, “Do we have enough protection? Are our staff suitably skilled?”. According to Mr Beck, the weakest point in security is the staff. Training them to be security conscious is a never-ending battle and Mr Beck realizes that it is one of the most challenging aspects of his work. Security is the opposite of convenience and while some staff might find it easier to login to their workstations with a simple password such as Allan246, it will not stop a hacker from brute forcing that password quickly and gaining access to the network to infect it with ransomware. The dangers this threat pose to the business as a whole is quite devastating both financially and in terms of reputation. As the threat landscape increases and matures, its more and more important to work proactively to combat this issue. It is quite challenging indeed and as Mr Beck indicated to us in his interview, his goal is to employ an IT Professional with a background in Cybersecurity to work with him and his team to proactively monitor and respond to security threats to the school.

									<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
								</button>
								<div class="collapsible-target">

									<a><img src="images/autoveh.jpg" width=95% height=95% alt="Auto Veh image" alt="Auto Veh"></a>

									<p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) can be described as any vehicle that has the capability for motion and action with little to no human interference, whether that interference be remote or from inside the vehicle itself (Frazzoli, Dahleh, & Feron, 2002). Though the idea of them may seem futuristic, evidence of AVs exists as far back as 1986 at Carnegie-Mellon University in the form of the Navlab prototypes, though the functionality at the time was extremely basic due to the lack of compact computing power (Jochem, Pomerleau, Kumar & Armstrong, 1995). The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International, 2018) has outlined the 6 levels of vehicle automation from 0 to 5, with 0 having no automation and 5 being fully autonomous. Since the Navlab experiments at Carnegie-Mellon University, autonomous driving technology has come a long way and is now available to the consumer market from various automotive companies. Tesla’s Autopilot and General Motors’ (GM) Super Cruise are two such offerings, though currently they only offer level 2 automation. As can be seen in Figure 1, this is classed as partial automation and still requires constant monitoring by the driver.</p>
									<a><img src="images/AV.png" width=95% height=95% alt="AV image" alt="SAE Levels of Driving Automation"></a>
									<p>
										Figure 1 (Synopsys, 2020)
									</p>
									<p>
										Though there are AVs capable of level 4 automation, outdated legislation and infrastructure limits where they are safely able to function in a process known as geofencing (Synopsys, 2020). In 2018, an AV company by the name of Waymo announced a driverless taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona that would operate in four suburbs: Chandler, Tempe, Gilbert and Mesa (Sage, 2018). Initially, this service had a human behind the wheel to ensure a safe trip for passengers but, by the end of 2020 it was able to transition to a near driverless experience with each vehicle having a remote supervisor to assist when more dynamic situations would arise. For example, a Waymo spokesperson explained to Lee (2020) ‘if a Waymo vehicle detects that a road ahead may be closed due to construction, it can pull over and request a second set of eyes’. Waymo’s choice to start rolling out their service in these Phoenix suburbs is not an irrelevant detail as weather conditions play a big part in how well AVs operate.
									</p>
									<p>
										In the next 3 years and further moving forward, large amounts of autonomous vehicles are expected to be rapidly deployed around the world with the rise of sensor technologies and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). ABI Research (2018) predicts that approximately 8 million vehicles featuring level 3, 4 and 5 autonomous functions will be shipped in 2025 and available to the mass market. While the vehicles featuring level 3 and 4 AV functions may still need drivers due to certain driving conditions requiring human intervention, vehicles with level 5 autonomy will be able to operate completely autonomously with no driver intervention at all.
									</p>
									<p>
										Other sources, such as Underwood (2014), predict that AVs in 2025 may be able to operate on all forms of road – whether it be highway, urban or rural surfaces. They also predict full level 5 autonomy on all surfaces by at least 2035, effectively eliminating humans from behind the wheel.  Wardrop (2009) proposes that by 2022, 30% of all trucks operating in the United Kingdom have the potential to be fully automated while IEEE (2012) estimates that up to 75% of all vehicles on the road could be fully autonomous by 2040. In the transport and haulage industry, trucks and buses may be the first to see autonomous replacements as the routes taken are far less dynamic than those taken by private commuters.
									</p>
									<p>
										More and more countries are beginning to legalise the use of AVs on their roads such as the UK, Sweden, and the US. In 2017, Sweden launched the Drive Me project which saw 100 Volvo AVs go to families in Gothenburg. These vehicles were for use on public roads and did not require continuous supervision, allowing the driver to perform other tasks during their trips (Victor et al., 2017). With the research gathered from these countries, there may be more AVs on roads for our use sooner rather than later.
									</p>
									<p>
										The quick rise and development of AVs for use on roads is possible due to advancements in technologies such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors. LiDAR has the potential to provide reliable obstacle detection, coupled with the deployment of various Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) packages by OEMs.
									</p>
									<p>
										The technological developments of vehicle automation potentially can transform the workforce and impact jobs. The potential impact of automation on employment varies by occupation and sector, with more physical jobs in predictable environments being the most susceptible. These may include operating machinery and preparing fast food. Two more industries that may be affected by automation are collecting and processing data, with jobs such as mortgage origination, paralegal work, accounting, and back-office transaction processing seeing a significant decrease in available work (McKinsey & Co, 2017) due to the evolution of not just vehicle automation, but automation as a whole.
									</p>
									<p>
										AVs could cause a rise in energy consumption levels when they become the prevalent mode of transport. This predicted rise may be caused by an increased demand for travel due to the on-demand mobility they offer, which in turn increases the amount of energy used by AVs. Another driving factor for this rise may be because of the accessibility these vehicles provide, allowing people who do not drive as much or not have been driving for a period of time to make use of the services offered by AVs.
									</p>
									<p>
										At the same time, AVs may be able to help energy consumption due to efficient driving methods, through a concept known as platooning. Platooning is when multiple vehicles all operate in a tight group together which helps to reduce forces imposed upon the vehicles (especially those in the center) while driving. This method of driving is not possible for humans due to the reaction times required to brake without causing a crash. AVs would not have this issue due to their ability to communicate and execute commands based on their surroundings (Wadud, MacKenzie & Leiby, 2016).
									</p>
									<p>
										The establishment of AVs as the conventional method of both private and public transportation is still several years from fruition. Though level 5 autonomy is on the horizon, current AVs are only able to operate in a limited capacity – whether this limit be geofenced areas or the requirement of constant human oversight. As the adoption rate of AVs increases, positives and negatives may become more apparent in day-to-day life. Some such benefits may include a decrease in traffic congestion, increased mobility for people with disabilities or the elderly, and an overall safer experience for both pedestrians and drivers. With over 90% of crashes caused by human error (NHTSA, 2015) the adoption of AVs has the potential for a large positive impact on road safety due to the communicative ability they possess with each other. However, accidents are not always avoidable.
									</p>
									<p>
										AVs may encounter ethical issues relating to the safety of the driver versus the safety of pedestrians in impact scenarios. In these types of scenarios, a computer may make unpredictable decisions and end up causing more harm than a human driver. While there are benefits to consider, there are also negative aspects of AVs, such as the threat of cybersecurity related attacks. A person with malicious intent may be able to compromise an AV to disable safety features and cause an impact, steal private information such as where an individual may live or work, or reroute the destination of the AV. Due to the relatively small demand for AVs, another factor that is against them is the cost. Without a large network of AVs in operation and because they rely on communication within a network, congestion mitigation could be completely nullified due to the lack of information available. Weather and terrain may also have an adverse effect on AVs, with the functionality being reduced or even fully negated due to rain, snow or uneven terrain (Anderson et al., 2014). Until these issues are investigated further, autonomous driving may still be years away from being available to the public at large.

								<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Cloud Services</h2></button>
								<div class="collapsible-target">
									<a><img src="images/cloud.png" width=95% height=95% alt="cloud image" alt="cloud Services"></a>
									<p>
										What we see today as “The Cloud” and specifically cloud computing is the progression of a technical, economic and social evolution.’ (Oppitz, Marcus, and Peter Tomsu 2017, p 2) It really started with the invention of the World Wide Web otherwise known by most people these days as “The Internet”. The Internet has made it possible to provide on-demand technology services to a worldwide audience. As technology progressed over the years giving us faster computers and faster internet access, these two advances have given us access to Cloud Computing. The Cloud delivers an integrated suite of functions and services to its users through workflows and virtualisation delivered over the Internet. It uses IT Infrastructure as an on-demand service and can be defined in three distinct layers. The Software as a Service (SaaS) layer where you do not manage anything and just access the Application front-end, examples of which include online email clients such as Gmail and Office tools such as Office 365. Platform as a Service (PaaS) which is used for developing and deploying software and services where you manage the Application and the Data, examples of which are Windows Azure, Heroku and Google App Engine. Thirdly the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) where you are managing everything down to the OS level and Runtime environment, examples of which are Rackspace, Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. With such large organisations now providing Cloud services and competing with each other for private and government contracts alike, more capital is being invested in the development of Cloud services which will benefit all consumers.   In November 2018, The Wall Street Journal stated that “there’s no end in sight to the cloud’s growth: By 2024, the global cloud computing market is expected to surpass $1 trillion.” (Foutty and Bawa 2018, para 5).
									</p>
									<p>
										From a technical viewpoint, Cloud systems comprise of processing, network and storage elements. There are 3 primary deployment models for Cloud Computing. The first is the Public Cloud. This is the cloud we are most familiar with as it hosts the majority of currently used cloud services including Dropbox and Facebook. A connection to the Public cloud is accessing data that is hosted in a data centre which is managed by a third-party provider over the internet. In a public cloud system, there are many organisations sharing the same IT infrastructure. The second is the Private Cloud which is primarily used by companies that are concerned with storing their data on publicly accessible servers. This system uses servers and hardware owned by the company and access can be provided either over the internet or over a private internal network. The last model is a Hybrid Cloud model which uses a combination of models 1 and 2. An example of which would be a company that uses a Hybrid email system with some accounts hosted on Office 365 and others hosted internally on their own Exchange servers. Communication is established between the two systems and they function as one hybrid email system.
									</p>
									<p>
										As Cloud computing is on demand and is provided from servers globally, it can be flexible in the delivery of storage and computing power growing and contracting with your business needs. This is referred to as elasticity in business terms as the service can literally contract and expand with your needs. As your business needs change, you can access cloud services to store or back up data, process data or to stream videos for training or meeting purposes, on a pay as you use pricing structure. This also can eliminate or reduce the capital set up costs of buying hardware and software, as well as the need for onsite infrastructure, further reducing business costs such as in physical space, electricity, and staffing. In most cases, you only pay for what you use, further lowering business costs and allowing for more flexibility.
									</p>
									<p>
										Cloud computing has had a dramatic impact on society today. It has also had a largely positive impact on businesses and organisations by increasing their revenue and helping them achieve their goals. It provides technology at reduced cost, by using resources on demand only with zero upfront costs. Cloud technology is also highly scalable according to the needs of an organisation. Companies no longer need to worry about future growth as the technology can easily adapt and scale with their growth. As for the everyday person, cloud technology has provided us with IOT devices connecting our homes in smart ways, cloud storage for our backups and our photos, social media to connect with family and friends over great distances as well as providing us with Online Learning capabilities which have now become mainstream in Universities all over the world. Especially in these days with threats like COVID-19, cloud computing has had a major impact on the Education word. It provided remote learning and video conferencing tools to staff and students during a lockdown allowing the continuation of studies without the need to attend school.

								<div class="collapsible-target">
									<a><img src="images/CS.png" width=95% height=95% alt="CS image" alt="Cyber Security"></a>

									<p>
										Cybersecurity has fast become one of the most important facets of Information Technology and this is largely to do with the fact that there has been a significant growth in the industry over the last decade. As technology advances, so does societal dependency. It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid such advancements, which is why IT professionals from all around the world have recognised the impact of cybercrime and are implementing protective measures for individuals and organisations against malicious activities.
									</p>
									<p>
										Cybersecurity incidents occur frequently and are not discriminative, in the fact that they target anyone. Currently, there are numerous methods of counteracting malicious attacks, but they boil down to two main categories, those being reactive and proactive countermeasures.
									</p>
									<p>
										Reactive cybersecurity methods are those that have been implemented to detect a threat already inside your host system or network, such as a Breach Detection Systems (BDS). Whereas a proactive cybersecurity measures are used to pre-empt an attack on a computer system or network and one example of this is Virtual Dispersive Networking (VDN).
									</p>
									<p>
										VDN is a preventative approach to cybercrime as it enables data segmentation during transmission. This means that the data packet has been broken into several segments that use separate optimal paths for transmission. In the event of an eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle (MIM) attack, only a portion of the data is at risk of interception.
									</p>
									<p>
										Cyber security in its infancy was response driven, largely waiting for a cyber-attack to occur before implementing counteractive measures and new computing standards. In order to reduce the ever-present risk of cybercrime, it is important to introduce proactive measures that analyse the network and predict malware.
									</p>
									<p>
										The majority of security professionals these days use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor the constant flow of attacks and respond as needed. However, this is unsustainable due to the demand it places on the workforce. It is also difficult to gain expertise in this way as the turnover for such jobs is so large. A much better way to combat this would be to use behaviour analysis combined with AI and deep learning to automate some of the work and highlight alerts for the attention of the security monitors. An example of this is Veksler and Buchler’s (2016) proposal for a Symbolic Deep Learning System which can be used to construct alternative user models. Their method is able to classify a large set of small data into models that can be used for security analysis.
									</p>
									<p>
										With the rise of multi-factor authentication systems and embedded hardware authentication, companies such as Google, Microsoft, Lastpass and Yubikey are leading the charge in making security more user-friendly and mainstream. Their efforts help to increase our defences against hackers trying to access our emails, personal data and bank accounts.
									</p>
									<p>
										Technological developments are one way that we will be better positioned to combat Cyber-threats. Identity management with the use of Apples Touch-ID and Face-ID technologies are just one example of this currently in use today. It is possible that 20 years from now, we will not need to rely on these devices to store our identity but rather through the use of Biometric implants. Of course, technologies such as that carry with it an inherent distrust and risk of abuse by governments and organisations. That said, the increased rampant threat of identity threat and fraud may be enough to sway public opinion.
									</p>
									<p>
										The movement towards IPv6 brings with it not just a substantial increase in the number of IP addresses available, but also several security enhancements as well. These include mandatory IPSEC, mandatory multicast, mandatory QoS, no more NAT and many new rules for network technologies. However, the adoption of IPv6 faces many hurdles and since it’s largely new code it’s likely to have many flaws and vulnerabilities in the early stages. Regardless, ISPs are already deploying IPv6 capable routers and services so adoption of this new technology may happen sooner than later.
									</p>
									<p>
										Machine AI and Deep Learning may be one of the key technologies in the future that can be better suited to detect and stop cyber threats. They are able to collate and compare many sources of data and be far more accurate than human eyes in identifying the characteristics and signatures of threats allowing us to better respond to their persistent attacks.
									</p>
									<p>
										“Our society, economy, and critical infrastructures have become largely dependent on computer networks and information technology solutions” (Jang-Jaccard & Nepal 2014). This reliance has created both risks and opportunities and underscores the value of cyber security in professional and personal contexts. When an organisation is reactive to threats or breaches rather than proactive, the likely impacts include data loss, exposure of private or sensitive information, reputational damage, potential fines due to the breaches as well as damages and costs to clients and suppliers as a consequence of these breaches.
									</p>
									<p>
										Inadequate security by an organisation that stores personal or sensitive information that is then attacked, can have wide reaching and long-lasting consequences.
									</p>
									<p>
										In July 2015, the theft of personal information from a dating website for people who are married or in relationships, Ashley Madison (or ALM) made global headlines when users' data was leaked online on searchable platforms. The reported fallout included divorces and suicides as personal data, including names, account transactions, addresses and personal messages were made public. Before leaking the data, the group responsible, known as the Impact Team, did not ask for money, but demanded that the parent company, Avid Dating Life close the site.  When they “dumped” the data, they wrote: “It was ALM that failed you and lied to you. Prosecute them and claim damages. Then move on with your life.” (Zetter 2015 para 18). Some of those affected did just that. In July 2017, ALM agreed to settle two dozen lawsuits for $11.2 million.
									</p>
									<p>
										This example shows that users may believe that they are protected, but if the organisation has inadequate protections in place, all are vulnerable.
									</p>
									<p>
										With advances in Cyber Security some older technologies that have known vulnerabilities and issues, for example - web servers and programming languages and libraries, will become redundant. New jobs will be created in the development of new technologies and cyber security has become a growth area within the Information Technology field.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Ernest and Young Global Information Security Survey of 2018 –19 estimated a global shortfall of about 1.8 million security professionals within five years. It also identified that to adequately fill these positions, women and minorities need to be a recruitment focus as “Diverse teams drive better results across the organization. They are more innovative, objective and collaborative. That’s critical in cybersecurity where every day is a fight to stay a step ahead of the attackers” (van Kessel 2018, p.7).
									</p>
									<p>
										Implementing state of the art technology to help impede cybersecurity incidents is essential to maintain positive control over our personal data. However, without the education to support such technologies, it would be unreasonable to suggest there will be a decline in cybercrime activities in the future.
									</p>
									<p>
										Educating your friends and family on the tell-tale signs of suspicious activity is the single most important response to mitigating the vast effects of a cybersecurity incident such as Phishing. Phishing is a phrase used to describe an email that is disguised to hide malware. Such emails are designed to look appealing to the recipient, in order to trick them into providing personal financial details or to click on a link that contains a scraping tool. According to an examination conducted by Verizon, 94% of malware was delivered through email in 2019 (Verizon, 2019). A statistic this high suggests that this method of delivery is effective in its intent to cause disruption or damage to networks and individuals and for its ease of distribution allowing significant global coverage.
									</p>
									<p>
										Intellectual property and other personal details such as financial or medical records are worth keeping protected. The most common type of protection available is in the form of a password. But far too often, bad password habits and a lack of password knowledge can cause significant vulnerabilities in your system, putting all your hard work and personal details at risk. Password Complexity Recommendations is a report that outlines how new and upcoming technology can be used to crack passwords using hash. The report suggests that using an 11-character password, containing a combination of uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers will add complexity to any good password (Defence Research and Development Canada, 2014).
									</p>
									<p>
										Technology should not solely be relied upon to create a safe haven for personal data or our most intellectual thoughts. Instead, educating family and friends about safe online practices may one day lead to lower cybercrime statistics.

								<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Raspberry Pi</h2></button>
								<div class="collapsible-target">
									<a><img src="images/RPi.png" width=95% height=95% alt="RPi image" alt="Raspberry Pi logo"></a>
									<p>
										A Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a Single Board Computer (SBC) and is typically the size of a credit card, easily being able to fit into your pocket. However, this is not recommended without first fitting it with a case to protect the internal electrical components. The RPi was first developed in the University of Cambridge’s Computer Laboratory in 2006 as an affordable computing platform for children to learn programming on (Ortmeyer, 2014). There are a number of different models within the RPi family, with the latest model – the Raspberry Pi 4 – having both USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports, an ethernet port, inbuilt wireless adapter, USB-C power supply input, a 40-pin general-purpose input/ouput (GPIO) pinout and micro-SD slot for storage purposes. The latest model, the Raspberry Pi 400, even comes with a mini keyboard built into the unit. Most commonly, RPi’s are bought alongside starter kits which contain all the components required to get it up and running. There are also more advanced kits that add camera modules which have the possibility for real world implementation.
									</p>
									<p>
										One example of this is a parking space management system proposed by Vítek and Melničuk (2017). In this scenario, a network of wireless cameras with RPi Zeros connected to each camera would relay positional data of vehicles back to a cloud server which then relays the potential vacancy of a parking spot to a client application. The RPi can also be used as a replacement for your desktop or laptop computer though there may be a significant performance decrease in favour of a smaller form factor. The RPi is often used in robotics, allowing users to program them for autonomous interaction with other technology.
									</p>
									<p>
										Though it was initially developed to encourage students to learn more about computer science, the RPi was able to sell 10 million units by 2016 with the CEO of the Raspberry Pi Foundation stating, ‘we’ve beaten our wildest dreams by three orders of magnitude, and we’re only just getting started’ (Upton, 2016). Though there have been SBCs before the RPi, they were often used in industrial settings in things like vending machines (Johnston and Cox, 2017). Due to the low price and availability of the RPi, there have been a myriad of experiments and prototypes created using its technology.
									</p>
									<p>
										The RPi is a popular SBC among the hobbyist crowd due to the ease in which it can be integrated with current devices to convert them to smart objects. Some examples of these projects include linking an RPI to a smart phone app to open a garage door (Coward, 2020), a home media centre (Parecki, 2020) and an ad blocker for your home network (Pi-hole, 2021). Besides in-home use, the RPi has also seen use in the construction of interactive art. In 2013, the University of Southampton featured an exhibit titled Erica the Rhino as part of a campaign to raise awareness for rhino conservation. In this exhibit, the audience was able to interact with a sculpture of a rhino by stroking it, feeding it or even sending it tweets (Basford et al., 2016). Through this interaction, Erica was able to produce an output based on what element the audience interacted with. This interactivity was achieved with a few RPi units, some sensors and some programming. Another facet of RPi use is for educational purposes, with several courses on offer through the Raspberry Pi website for students to learn programming.
									</p>
									<p>
										As the Raspberry Pi (RPi) is an inexpensive piece of hardware it has helped revolutionise the education system. The devices basic computing functionality paired with its potential for further programming, will allow schools and universities alike, to manipulate the current curriculum to accommodate numerous learning styles. One such university has already implemented the use of a RPi in their Undergraduate Physics degree. The RPi has been programmed with an open-source software package known as the PhyPiDAQ, which essentially allows the students manage data acquisition using sensory control over digital inputs and outputs. This software also permits students to configure the RPi is ways necessary for them to complete a specific component of an experiment, such as, sensor position, acceleration, temperature, current and force while having the ability to display these findings through GUI in real time (Wong, Quast & Braig, 2020). The fact that RPi’s can be used as an interactive approach to learning with the added ability of repetitive use shows the usefulness of such devices.
									</p>
									<p>
										Another study has shown, that RPi have been tested in conjunction with the cloud to assist law enforcement officers in identifying suspects using facial recognition (Sajjad et al. 2020). The trail successfully utilised the RPi 3 model B, using 2.7 Python as the programming language. As RPi has limited resources such as storage, processing power and memory, so it was paired with a cloud service to counteract the technological shortfall. Law Enforcement officers used a small wireless camera that processes live camera footage through the RPi for facial recognition. The program then uses other technologies such as a support vector machine, which helped identify suspects (Sajjad et al. 2020).
									</p>
									<p>
										This is just two examples on how the RPi can effect change on a large scale if used appropriately. As RPi’s are still relativity juvenile, it will be interesting to see what it can do in the future, to really unlock the potential of human capacity.
									</p>
									<p>
										For your average gaming enthusiast, the Raspberry Pi has given new meaning to old school gaming by officially reviving ‘retro’ gaming consoles. Currently, the RPi can be used to power the console that hosts fan-favourite past-time games, all emulated within the retro-pie interface. It encourages intergeneration participation, one great example, is uniting my family together, especially my father and grandfather as we explore our favourite past times together.
									</p>
									<p>
										Not only does RPi rebirth retro gaming, but it can also be used as a very low-cost computer. Nowadays, purchasing a basic computer or laptop for a school age student can be expensive, especially when you need to take other expenses into consideration, like, school uniforms and all those other back-to-school basics. A RPi can generate enough power for basic computing requirements, such as basic applications to conduct homework or school assignments. Leisurely, it also acts as the perfect platform for you to teach your niece or nephew about programming languages or introduce them to Minecraft and Minecraft Mods.
									</p>
									<p>
										It is interesting to see how the RPi has developed and what technologies it has influenced over the last decade but more so in its contribution to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic itself has seen the IT industry expand to meet rising demands, but more so in the medical department of Columbian hospitals, where the RPi was used to help control ventilators of COVID patients (Thomas, 2020). The RPi was designed to control the air pressure, open and close valves and regulate breathing assistance. If this small single board computer can make changes that will aid patients in a pandemic, it is safe to say that this technology will contribute to further developments in the future. Who knows, it might just save your life or a life of a loved one.

					<h1 style="text-align:center;"> <b> Caffeina </h1>
						<h2 style="text-align:center;"> <i> For the love of coffee </i> </h2>	
						<br>
						<h2 <b> Overview </b> </h2>
						<p> Caffeina is a user-friendly application to monitor water intake based on caffeine consumed for the fitness and health-conscious individual. Conway (2020) states that coffee is one of the most popular drinks consumed worldwide, the goal is to ensure that users are keeping up with recommended water intake to compensate for the diuretic effect that caffeine can cause. This ensures optimum health and hopefully relieves any guilt of caffeine consumption for the health conscious. Caffeina will be designed to be user friendly and simplistic, not wanting to add to your health routine, but enhance it. It will provide the user with notifications and rewards to help keep them on track and motivated to continue using the application. </p>
						<p> 
							<h2 <b> Motivation </b> </h2>
						<p> Caffeina was inspired by the developer’s love affair with coffee and her interest in wearable technology and fitness. The goal was to create a user friendly application to seamlessly integrate into the user's daily fitness and health routine. She was motivated by the idea that technology can enhance the users' journey to a healthy lifestyle as well as enhance their overall wellbeing. She, along with the development team, wanted to ensure that the application use did not feel like a chore for the user, but was a fun enhancement to their lifestyle. </p>
						<p>
						<h2 <b> Description </b> </h2>
						<h3 <b> <i> The Application </i> </b> </h3>	
						<p> Caffeina will be available on either iOS or Android and can be downloaded for free from your respective app store. Using a smart device, connected to the internet, simply download the application and create an account. To simplify the account creation process, it can be done one of two ways, either linking an existing account from Facebook, Google and Apple or by manually entering the required data into the respective fields. If the user decides to keep the account separate from pre-existing accounts, a valid email address and a strong password will be required. On successful login, three additional questions will present to the user, such as, gender, height and weight. This will help personalise the account and increase the accuracy of the data that is sent to the user - in the form of a caffeine consumption calculator. </p>
						<p> Once logged in, the first page that will appear to the user will be the coffee selection page. This page will contain three interactive lists that are titled, Caffè, Milk and Sugar. The Caffè list will contain common types of coffees such as Espresso, Ristretto, Instant, Caffè Latte, Flat White, Cappuccino, Mocha and Americano. As the user selects the desired type of coffee, the ‘Milk’ list will become active. This only occurs if the user selects a coffee that contains a milk-based product. The user can then select what type of milk they want, low-fat, full cream, almond, coconut and so on. As the ‘Milk’ is selected the application will then ask the user if they would like sugar, in a simple yes or no icon. Lastly the user will be able to select the size of the drink they are consuming, such as Espresso, Cappuccino, Latte, even Venti and Grande. </p>
						<p> On completion of the selected item, the application will generate a coffee icon in the middle of the page, which has been programmed to allow easy user interaction. For instance, double tapping the icon, indicates that the user has ordered a double shot coffee. Don’t feel like caffeine today, swipe the icon to the left to specify Decaf. Decided to have a late afternoon coffee but don’t want to be up all night, hold the icon down until it flashes and then slide down, selecting half strength.</p>
						<p> Another amazing feature is the automatic caffeine to rehydration tally. This indicates how much water the user needs to consume to level out the diuretic effect that coffee can have on the human body. Located at the top of the page, are small coffee cups that indicate how many coffees you have consumed that day. By simply tapping on the icon, it shows the user how much water they need to consume. Once the water has been consumed, the user can tick off the cup and it will fade indicating that this challenge has been completed. Don’t worry, if you forget to drink the required amount of water in the specified time period, a push notification will be sent to your phone to remind you. </p>
						<p> For the application to work flawlessly, the caffeine to water consumption needs to be regulated by a formula. For every 100mg of caffeine consumed an additional cup of water (250ml) should be consumed to compensate for the diuretic effect (SFGATE 2018). The following example will provide an insight on how this is calculated on the server side of the application.</p>
						<p> 1 x Espresso (shot only - 30ml) = 63.6mg of caffeine </p>							
           				 <p> 63.6 ÷ 100 = 0.636 </p>
 					  <p> 0.636 * 250mL = 159mL </p>
						<p> Based on this example, the consumer will need to consume 0.7 cups of water to remain hydrated after consuming an Espresso. In order to display this information to the user in an easy to read and interpret format, cups will be either display in a half or full capacity, equating to, 1 x Espresso = 1 cup of water.</p>  
						<p> The application will also be able to provide a statistical summary for the user of their coffee consumption filtered daily, weekly, or monthly. Using this data, the application can provide feedback to the user warning them if they have consumed too much coffee over a certain period. </p>
						<p> </p>
						<h2 <b> Basic Application Designs </b> </h2> 
<p> </p>
<h3 <b> <i> Coffee Version Release: </b> </i> </h3>
<p> Each eversion release will contain a scheduled update that will improve overall useability, bug fixing and software assessments to ensure the integrity and validity of the product has been maintained. Time and dates for each release, will be available online, prior to the update going live. </p>  
<h3 <b> <i> Version II </b> </i> </h3>
<p>Tech Inception will expand the Caffè selection range and introduce an improved list of milk types. Also, in version 2, you can expect to see a new tab that introduces the Favourites Menu. This menu is automatically generated by using analytical data gathered from its userbase. This will help streamline the process and get you rehydrated faster.  </p>  
<h3 <b> <i>Version III </b> </i> </h3>
<p>Caffeina lovers can expect to see an added calorie counting feature in the V3 release. Tech Inception, paired with the expertise of their inhouse Nutritionist, Daniela, will research the number of calories included in each item on the selected menu. To make this user friendly, a formula will be used to convert kilojoules to calories to give the consumer real time information upfront, in an easy to interpret format.  </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3 <b> <i>Version IV </b> </i> </h3>
<p> Coffee selection and calorie counting just got easier with barcode scanning. Using your current smart device, simply scan the product barcode to receive in app, real time feedback. This feature also supports the recommended water consumption required to maintain hydration l House on registration. After the user selects the coffee and the size, they specify how much sugar or extra milk they want and mark the coffee as Consumed. </p>  
<h3 <b> <i>Version V </b> </i> </h3>
<p> Tech Inceptions biggest release yet. Introducing Caffeina to wearables. The application will now be supported on the Apple Watch and Android Smartwatches. This cross-platform model is designed to allow basic application interactions only, for instances, ticking off your coffee cups to indicate you have completed that rehydration challenge and to check the progress of the user's other goals. </p>   
<h3 <b> <i>Version VI </b> </i> </h3>
<p> Tech Inception has started making headwind for competitors with the Version VI release of Siri and Google Assistant integration. The user can now use voice commands to interact with the application. For example, user - “Hey Siri, I just drank a cup of coffee”. Siri - “Your required water consumption is 250ml”. This enables a handsfree approach to the application, allowing the user to continue with their busy schedule. </p>  
<h3 <b> <i>Version VII </b> </i> </h3>
<p> Version VII will introduce an NFC support module, allowing users to bump their watch or phone against an imbedded NFC tag to increase the coffee count instead of tapping the icon on their device. Tech Inception could start selling accessories with NFC tags pre-inserted, these items could include coffee cups/travel mugs, coasters or even stickers. Once the user has finished their cup of coffee, they would contact one of these NFC compatible items using either their Apple Watch or smartphone to record the drink. These tags would have to be pre-programmed before shipping, thus limiting the kind of coffee it could record to only one type per tag. </p>  
<h3 <b> <i> Other Proposed Future Developments </i> </b> </h3>
<p> In order to make the most out of the application and support local businesses, Tech Inception have decided to link our application to various coffee stores. This can be done in a variety of ways. One, members from Tech Inception visit local coffee stores and ask them to sign up for registration on our application or two, registration for more remote stores can be done online. Registering with our applications only requires a few details, including company name, coffee types and coffee ratios unique to their store. This data will be entered into the Caffeina database which is cloud stored.  </p>  
<p> How the store benefits – when a Caffeina user enters your store using our application, NFC, QR Codes or location data will present the user with unique coffee selections relevant to that store. An example scenario would be as follows: Caffeina user walks into Coffee House (local Coffee Business). The app uses their location to determine where they are and displays the name ‘Coffee House’ at the top.  It will also list all the coffees currently available in store. The user then decides to order a Cappuccino and the application then shows the available sizes being a Regular or Large. When the user selects regular, the application already knows the size of the cup including the coffee to water ratio content according to the data provided by our database. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 <b> Obstacles and Drawbacks </b> </h2> 
<h3 <b> <i> Platform Development </b> </i> </h3> 
<p> Picking the right platform for the initial launch of Caffeina may require some thought. In Australia, the most popular mobile OS is Apple’s iOS claiming a 54% share compared to Android’s 45%. When compared to the worldwide stats however, this changes to Android at 72% and iOS at 26% (StatCounter Global Stats, 2020). Do we develop for the broader platform in Australia, or cater to the larger worldwide demographic?  </p> 
<p> Developing for a specific platform has its pros and cons, but so does developing for cross-platform use. Cross-platform apps are generally easier to maintain but may not offer much integration with other apps and services. Platform specific apps allow integration with other services like Siri or Google Assistant, as well as increased optimisation. Although, it would also require several different versions of the app due to the varied nature of the Android platform. Early prototypes may be developed with the cross-platform method in mind, allowing the features to be added and iterated upon until they are polished enough for Version V, the wearables update. This version requires specific platform development to function as detailed.  </p> 
<p> Currently, no members of Tech Inception have experience with developing mobile apps. This may require a prototype version of Caffeina to be coded and deployed as a very basic program or webpage, or for Tech Inception to seek outside assistance with later versions of Caffeina. </p> 
<h3 <b> <i> Performance vs. Battery Life </b> </i> </h3> 
<p> Caffeina will not be a resource demanding app due to its relatively simplistic nature, but some considerations will still need to be made with regards to performance and battery life. For example, the app does not need to be constantly running in the background to store the cups of coffee you have had throughout the day and only needs to retrieve and modify this data when another cup of coffee is consumed. Such data would be stored locally instead of in the cloud to prevent unnecessary battery usage. This would also increase the responsiveness of the app as it would not need to download the data to modify it.  </p>  
<h3 <b> <i> Accuracy of Data </i> </h3> 
<p> While the data used by Tech Inception will consist of accurate caffeine measurements based on regular cup sizes and formulas based on these sizes, the user may not enter their data correctly. If the user is having coffee at home, they could unintentionally brew a weaker/stronger coffee or have a larger than usual mug, thus causing the recommended amount of water suggested to be inaccurate.</p>   
<h2 <b> Tools, Technologies & Skills </b> </h2>
<h3 <b> <i> Hardware </i> </b> </h3>
<p> Caffeina is a free iOS or Android app and requires an up-to-date device to make use of all its features. For optimal functionality of the application, it is recommended that users, use a phone that was developed within the last 5 years, and contains the most recent update.  </p>   
<h3 <b> <i> Software / Tools </i> </b> </h3>
<h3 <b> React Native </b> </h3>
<p> While there are obstacles that may stand in the way of Tech Inception developing Caffeina, there are also solutions to these problems. React Native is a cross platform development kit that uses JavaScript. It is used by many popular apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Discord, Pinterest and many more. One of its main strengths is the ability to write modules in C, Swift and Java, as well as work on image and video processing directly. It is one of the best platforms to use as it is very fast for converting your code into native elements quickly. Among some other big benefits for using React Native are Lower Development costs because we would be developing for both iOS and Android at the same time requiring less developers. There is also a large developer community for React and since it primarily uses JavaScript it will be much easier to hire a developer since Swift is much less popular. Lastly React can also be used to create a web application version for the app. Not something needed initially but worth considering down the line. React does not support the creation of wearable device apps from either iOS or Android so other development tools must be used for that such as XCode. </p><br>
