										<a><img src="images/Joe_head.png" width=20% height=20% alt="Joseph"></a>
										<h2>Joseph</h2>
										<p>Joseph Thannheiser (s3887138) is 24 years old, was born in Brisbane and has lived in Queensland for most of his life. At the end of October 2020, he moved to Sydney, New South Wales and is now only a 10-minute walk from Bondi Beach. Growing up, he attended Wellington Point State High School in South East Queensland and graduated in 2013. He has always enjoyed using technology – whether it be to play games, communicating with friends and peers, or to study online. Joseph is currently studying with RMIT and is enrolled in Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming. Though his experience with IT is mostly informal, Joseph has learned a lot about both computer software and hardware as well as how to build and maintain his own PC. In his free time, he enjoys playing video games, going to the beach, and hanging out with his partner Eloise and their new kitten Rudy.</p>
										<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
										<p>Joseph has completed the Myer-Briggs Personality Type (MBTI) test, the Honey and Mumford Learning Styles (HMLS) test, and the Big Five Personalities Test. Regarding the MBTI, Joseph is an ISFJ or Defender type. This personality type is defined as being reliable, altruistic and patient with some negatives being shy or excessive humility, taking things too personally and reluctant to changes.  His Learning Style result shows that he prefers pragmatic learning styles which is the dominant learning style in the group. Joseph’s Big Five results are in line with the results from his MBTI test – again showing that he is introverted and conscientious while being agreeable and calm.
										In team situations, Joseph prefers to follow instructions instead of giving them out. Though the Defender personality is also classed as loyal and hard-working, they can also be prone to bouts of procrastination. Joseph can adapt to new situations and groups well enough but prefers to be quiet and listen instead of making decisions.

										<a><img src="images/Ben_head.png" width=20% height=20% alt="Benjamin"></a>
										<h2>Benjamin</h2>
										<p>Benjamin James Snelgrove was born in Sydney, Australia in 1994. He attended Kingswood High School in Greater Western Sydney and successfully attained his Higher School Certificate in 2011. At the beginning of 2012, Benjamin enlisted into the Australian Army and was posted to Darwin. Benjamin has been fortunate enough to move around Australia and live in some incredible places. This within itself, this has presented Benjamin with both challenges and opportunities, for which he is grateful for. Benjamin is currently studying, Introduction to Information Technology at RMIT and can be found by using his unique student number -s3883299. Unfortunately, Benjamin does not have any experience within IT but his interests lie within Cyber Security with the hope to secure employment, on completion of his studies. Benjamin’s hobbies include playing golf, working out, gaming and spending quality time with his wife, Tina.</p>
										<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
										<p>The MBTI and Leadership Style Assessment have defined Benjamin’s traits as being an Executive and a Transformative leader. A close analysis determined his persona to be direct, dedicated, hardworking, strong willed and above all Benjamin places a high value on honesty and integrity. He has little tolerance for those who those who do not share the same values and can be seen as judgemental and inflexible. As a Transformative Leader, Benjamin places a high importance on understanding team dynamics and individual motivations. He tends to weigh in on options while analysing risk versus rewards and recognises that simplicity is best achieved by providing clear direction and guidance.
										Benjamin is a Pragmatist learner which was determined by the Honey and Mumford Learning Style test. This style of learning is best achieved through practical's, case studies, problem settings and discussions as opposed to other learning methods like storytelling or models.
										For the group to function effectively, Benjamin has identified possible friction points that might arise due to the aforementioned test results. He needs to consider his approach and use language that is appropriate for the target audience, in order to break down barriers and communicate effectively. Benjamin also needs to understand that people will work within their own capacity and expectations require adjustment as individual efforts, great or small are essential to team success. The importance of knowing and understanding each other’s learning style will allow team members to effectively assist another member and provide a personalised approach to guidance and mentoring.</p>

										<a><img src="images/Brandon_head.png" width=20% height=20% alt="Brandon"></a>
										<h2>Brandon</h2>
										<p>Brandon Ferguson (s3876709) currently a student at RMIT, was born in 1999 at Geelong Hospital and has lived there his whole life. Brandon was employed by McDonalds for 5 years and completed VCE at North Geelong Secondary College in 2016. In his spare time, Brandon enjoys training at the gym, enjoys life's adventures, plays a lot of video games and spending quality time with friends and family. From an early age, Brandon developed a keen interest in IT, as his love for video gaming opened another doorway to creating and hosting private servers. But still even with doing what he found entertaining in the tech world, Brandon is yet to acquire the related qualifications and experience to move to the next level.</p>
										<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
										<p>Brandon has taken 3 personality tests, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (16 Personalities) test, the Honey and Mumford Learning styles test and finally the Big Five Personality styles test.
										The MBTI test indicated that Brandon is a Turbulent Mediator, which means that he is quite laid back, prefers to remain in the shadows and could even be labelled as shy and introverted person. He will listen to what other have to say and just go with the flow which is good when he is in a group with people who like to make orders and assign tasks to him. The tests also show that he likes to speak the truth, when he says something as rare as that moment, it will come from the heart.
										The Honey and Mumford learning styles test indicate that Brandon’s primary learning style is the Activist learning style which means Brandon is very open-minded, enthusiastic and flexible which can be useful when working with others as he can agree with almost anything that the team suggests. This tends to lead to less conflict in the decision-making process and allows things to get moving in order to complete the task.
										Unlike the previous tests, the Big Five Personality test says that Brandon is quite extroverted which shows in certain situations. Brandon can sometimes be introverted or extroverted, which is why Brandon likes to label himself as an introverted extrovert. His emotional stability is quite high which allows him to handle criticism well which is good when working in a group as it helps him progress through his flaws.

								<h2> Cloud Services </h2>
								<p> What we see today as “The Cloud” and specifically cloud computing is the progression of a technical, economic and social evolution.’ (Oppitz, Marcus, and Peter Tomsu 2017, p 2) It really started with the invention of the World Wide Web otherwise known by most people these days as “The Internet”. The Internet has made it possible to provide on-demand technology services to a worldwide audience. As technology progressed over the years giving us faster computers and faster internet access, these two advances have given us access to Cloud Computing. The Cloud delivers an integrated suite of functions and services to its users through workflows and virtualisation delivered over the Internet. It uses IT Infrastructure as an on-demand service and can be defined in three distinct layers. The Software as a Service (SaaS) layer where you do not manage anything and just access the Application front-end, examples of which include online email clients such as Gmail and Office tools such as Office 365. Platform as a Service (PaaS) which is used for developing and deploying software and services where you manage the Application and the Data, examples of which are Windows Azure, Heroku and Google App Engine. Thirdly the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) where you are managing everything down to the OS level and Runtime environment, examples of which are Rackspace, Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. With such large organisations now providing Cloud services and competing with each other for private and government contracts alike, more capital is being invested in the development of Cloud services which will benefit all consumers.   In November 2018, The Wall Street Journal stated that “there’s no end in sight to the cloud’s growth: By 2024, the global cloud computing market is expected to surpass $1 trillion.” (Foutty and Bawa 2018, para 5).

From a technical viewpoint, Cloud systems comprise of processing, network and storage elements. There are 3 primary deployment models for Cloud Computing. The first is the Public Cloud. This is the cloud we are most familiar with as it hosts the majority of currently used cloud services including Dropbox and Facebook. A connection to the Public cloud is accessing data that is hosted in a data centre which is managed by a third-party provider over the internet. In a public cloud system, there are many organisations sharing the same IT infrastructure. The second is the Private Cloud which is primarily used by companies that are concerned with storing their data on publicly accessible servers. This system uses servers and hardware owned by the company and access can be provided either over the internet or over a private internal network. The last model is a Hybrid Cloud model which uses a combination of models 1 and 2. An example of which would be a company that uses a Hybrid email system with some accounts hosted on Office 365 and others hosted internally on their own Exchange servers. Communication is established between the two systems and they function as one hybrid email system.

As Cloud computing is on demand and is provided from servers globally, it can be flexible in the delivery of storage and computing power growing and contracting with your business needs. This is referred to as elasticity in business terms as the service can literally contract and expand with your needs. As your business needs change, you can access cloud services to store or back up data, process data or to stream videos for training or meeting purposes, on a pay as you use pricing structure. This also can eliminate or reduce the capital set up costs of buying hardware and software, as well as the need for onsite infrastructure, further reducing business costs such as in physical space, electricity, and staffing. In most cases, you only pay for what you use, further lowering business costs and allowing for more flexibility.

Cloud computing has had a dramatic impact on society today. It has also had a largely positive impact on businesses and organisations by increasing their revenue and helping them achieve their goals. It provides technology at reduced cost, by using resources on demand only with zero upfront costs. Cloud technology is also highly scalable according to the needs of an organisation. Companies no longer need to worry about future growth as the technology can easily adapt and scale with their growth. As for the everyday person, cloud technology has provided us with IOT devices connecting our homes in smart ways, cloud storage for our backups and our photos, social media to connect with family and friends over great distances as well as providing us with Online Learning capabilities which have now become mainstream in Universities all over the world. Especially in these days with threats like COVID-19, cloud computing has had a major impact on the Education word. It provided remote learning and video conferencing tools to staff and students during a lockdown allowing the continuation of studies without the need to attend school.

Along with the good however comes also the bad, and there have been some negative aspects of Cloud computing that have also had major impacts on IT today. In particular the security of your data, when stored on cloud servers, can be compromised when the company hosting that data has a security breach and loses customer data because their security practices were insufficient to protect it. IoT devices that provide us with such simple and easy to use home management and automation, have been targeted by hackers and used as botnets or attack vectors into our homes. It seems that the more connected we become to the world over the internet the more we expose ourselves to the dangers of Cyber-threats. We must stay educated and informed about these dangers and perhaps the key will be to educate the younger generation to be aware of these security risks and take steps to protect their data and privacy in a more proactive way.

As “cloud providers are battling for market position, which is leading them to reduce their public IaaS cloud prices” (Serrano, Gallardo & Hernantes 2015 p.4), small business, start-ups and personal users benefit with free and low-cost cloud services that are constantly adapting and innovating. Examples of this include free mail services such as Gmail and Dropbox, a cloud-based storage application, which provides up to 1TB of free storage and the platform facilitates the easy sharing of files with others.  Families and friends are able to connect and celebrate anytime via Cloud based video applications including Google Hangouts, Skype and Zoom.  Cloud services are also used by streaming services such as Spotify and Netflix to store playlists, liked movies and watch lists - this data is used to make recommendations based on usage history to enhance your experience.

Education institutions were quick to see the benefit of cloud services to deliver courses and content online. This opened up new markets with students from all over the world and those seeking flexible study options.

The Banking industry also quickly integrated Cloud technologies to facilitate and streamline services including payments, loan applications and provide customer service.

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the value of the Cloud for personal and business use with access to secure networks via the Cloud allowing workplaces to adapt to a work from home model.   “With the cloud, employees are always connected to the server. This means as long as they have internet connection they can work wherever they like, allowing employees to work in an environment that is better adjusted to their specific needs” (Penman 2020, para. 5).   </p>
